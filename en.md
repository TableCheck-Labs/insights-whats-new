### New Insight releases! (5th October, 2023)
It's been an exciting few weeks for Insight, with the recent release of our EDM dashboard, empowering venues to close the loop on guest experiences.
We're happy to announce the following improvements to your Insight experience!
* New charts for tracking EDM account health, answering questions such as:
  * Why are recipients being skipped?
  * What's my bounce/complaint/unsubscribe rate per campaign?
  * What is a healthy bounce/complaint metric?
* New Insight-wide timezone display to allow you to find data when you're in a different timezone from your venues :clock4:
* Optimising your revenue from the beach in another timezone? Now you can easily look up your venue's timezones directly within Insight!
